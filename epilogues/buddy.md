Nadine: Hey Eris.

Eris: Yeah?

Nadine: You always have these cute little robots following you at times. What are those?

Eris: Oh, the B.U.D.D.?

Nadine Confused: The what?

Boxer: ❤️

Nadine Shocked: (startled) Wao!

Nadine Sad: D-Don't sneak up on me like that...

Eris: Why did you ask anyways?

Nadine: It seems really nice and friendly. I think I'd like a friend like that.

Eris: Hey, Boxer! (motions it to Nadine) Meet Nadine. I'm sure you've seen her around a bit the past few weeks.

Boxer: ❓

Eris Happy: I think you two would get along well!

Nadine Happy: You think so?

Scruffy Happy: (interrupting) Hey, Eris. What happens if I crack open a B.U.D.D. like an egg? Do you think there's a green yolk inside it?

Boxer: ❗ (hides behind Nadine in fear)

Nadine Angry: Hey! Don't scare the poor thing!

Eris Annoyed: Scruffy, can you leave for the rest of the episode?

Scruffy: Hmm.. I can try!

%Scruffy begins to spin around slowly, gradually speeding up til he flies towards the sky and disappears.

Nadine Shocked: ...

Eris Annoyed: ...

Eris: Hey, looks like Boxer seems pretty comfortable with you already!

Nadine Confused: Because it hid behind me?

Boxer: ❤️

%Boxer faces Eris and communicates with her.

Eris Happy: Sure! Go ahead!

Nadine Confused: Oh?

Eris: Boxer wants to hang around with you! 

Nadine Happy: Oh!! That's amazing! Let's go to the park or something, I'll show you the way, Boxer!
