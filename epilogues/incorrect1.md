I can't believe I'm saying this but do you guys know how chronically online you all are, thinking that saying “oOh iM a rEVeRsE nECrOmANcER i LOvE tO kiLL pEOpLe” is genuinely funny and will get everyone in the room shitting themselves from laughter?? Cause it's not. It’s fucking not. In fact, it's the unfunniest fucking joke ever. Not just any joke about killing people. This one specifically. It's so unfunny and stupid. Nobody is fucking laughing at that, Kranion. It makes you look like a greasy emo kid who has never been outside once in their life and uses tumblr religiously. Like not even the funny side of tumblr. The fucking unfunny side filled with overused jokes about murder and illegal acts. Honestly, you're so unfunny, Kranion. Fuck you.
