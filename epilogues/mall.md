% Saturday. The start of the weekend, many for which are off from work today. And what better way to spend your weekend and measly underpaid paycheck than a mall? Probably not. Either way, the usual trio: Scruffy, Eris, and Nadine enters the mall located not far from their apartment.

Nadine Glad: Oh boy, my first ever mall trip!

Eris Happy: Yeah, it's nice to bring you somewhere normal for a change. And there's lots of different stores to check out here!

Scruffy: The funny capitalism building!

Eris Annoyed: I hate that you're right... but let Nadine have this moment, at least before she discovers the crushing weight of American greed.

Nadine Annoyed: (mumbling to self) I would know what capitalism's greed is...

Scruffy: Ah, Santa logic, got it. Not that he isn't real or anything, I don't know why you keep telling me he isn't real.

Nadine Surprised: Of course Santa's real! What do you mean, Eris?

Eris Happy: Uhh, nothing! Now come on, let's pick a store to visit. What are you thinking, guys?

Scruffy: I want a hot dog!

Eris Annoyed: That's it. You just want a hot dog.

Scruffy: Uh, yeah.

Nadine Happy: That sounds amazing! Let's go see the hot dog!

Eris: Don't humor him. Nadine, why don't we go check out GameStore. Scruffy, why don't you meet up with us there after you get your hot dog.

Scruffy: Sure thing. Thanks for the 50 bucks by the way!

Eris Shocked: Wait, I didn't give you any money--

Scruffy: --what, can't hear you, see you in a bit!

Eris Annoyed: Ah, whatever, better he has something to focus on.

Nadine Confused: Do we really want to let him loose in a shopping mall like that?

Eris: He's not our problem right now. Anyways, let's go!

% Scruffy is in the backrooms.

Scruffy: This sure is one weird food court. All the hallways look the same! Maybe I'll go ask that horrifying looking entity for directions. Hey mister!

% Scruffy stands on a trap door, falling through it with a goofy holler. He lands in a completely empty desert.

Scruffy: Ah, found the ballpit! Just have to make my way weast...

% Eris and Nadine are at GameStore looking at all of the games on sale.

Nadine Happy: Hey look, it's Scruffy!

Eris: WHERE??? Oh, you just mean this game. Wait, what?

% Nadine is holding up a copy of Super Freaks 1 Ultimate Edition.

Eris Shocked: What the hell??? Oh god...

% The entire shelf is full of every Super Freaks game. Eris's eyes gradually widen in horror.

Nadine: Isn't this great? Our friend is in a video game series!! Look, even those evil skeletons are in these games!

Eris Annoyed: You don't say. Wait, what?

% Eris notices BUDD on the shelf and sees herself on the cover. In horror, she flips the box around and sees a screenshot of herself standing next to the Super Freaks in Barrel Canyon. She goes completely silent.

Nadine: Oh my god, guess what??? I have my own video game too! Look, it's called Prototype N, there I am!!! ...uh, are you ok?

% Back in the desert, Scruffy has stumbled upon what appears to be the same mall he got lost at in the first place.

Scruffy: There we go! I knew if I just headed weast I'd find my way back. I don't remember those demonic red lights shining out of the windows though.

% Scruffy goes inside of the mall. He finds it's completely empty, and all of the tile patterns on the walls and floors are slightly different.

Scruffy: Is it labor day? Pretty sure it's still early spring... maybe everyone left to go get a hot dog or something. Oh well, that means no lines!

% Scruffy makes his way up to the food court and finds that the hot dog stand is oozing blood, and it's seeping all over the floor.

Scruffy: Someone oughta tidy up this ketchup. They must be out of mustard and relish. Is there even anyone here?

% Scruffy leans over the edge of the hot dog stand.

Scruffy: Hellooooooo? Oops!

% Scruffy falls through an endless black void with an echoing goofy holler. Back in the normal mall, Nadine and Eris are carrying some shopping bags.

Nadine Glad: That was so fun! There was so much stuff everywhere!

Eris: Yeah, I told you it would be fun! I don't think we needed to buy every single Super Freaks game, but as long as you're having fun. Speaking of, where is that big headed acquaintance of ours?

% Scruffy lands on top of Eris and Nadine. A solid five seconds later, a mountain of sand gradually pours down and covers them entirely. Eris pokes her head out.

Eris Annoyed: Scruffy what did you--

% Eris looks around and sees that they're all back at their apartment.

Eris Shocked: How did we--

Nadine Surprised: Oh, wow, we're already home!

Scruffy: And I finally got my hot dog!

Eris Annoyed: I don't see you holding--

% Eris's arm is a hot dog, with green ketchup.

Eris Shocked: WHAT THE FU--

% Scruffy chomps on her arm. Eris wakes up screaming in her bed.

Eris: Oh thank God, it was just a dream. Wait a minute--

% Eris's bed is on top of a mountain of sand. Scruffy is sitting right next to her eating a hot dog with suspiciously green ketchup.

Scruffy: Sup.

% Eris wakes up screaming again, this time on a bench at the mall.

Nadine Sad: Come on Eris, we haven't gone to any stores yet!

Eris: Oh, what? Uhh, yeah, sure, uhh....

Scruffy: That's not entirely true, I went to the desert.

Eris Annoyed: You what?

Scruffy: Yeah. Got my hot dog by the way, ketchup was green for some reason. I'm gonna go get mustard, be right back.

Eris Annoyed: Uh, yeah, have...fun with that.

Nadine Sad: What's wrong?

Eris: A lot of things. Come on, let's go to the store.

Nadine Confused: Which one?

Eris: We went to GameStore already didn't we?

Nadine: No we didn't. That sounds fun! Come on, let's go!

% Nadine drags a very overwhelmed Eris to GameStore.
