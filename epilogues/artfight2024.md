@TITLE: Art Fight 2024 Results

%NOTE: Arrietty's mugshot sprite from Cyborg Resistance is created by SchAlternate. Thanks, SchAlternate!

Arrietty Happy: Hello all and welcome to the first annual results of Arrietty's Art Fight journey! (Although not actually my first year there...)

Nadine Confused: Huh? Art Fight? What's that?

Clara: That sounds... violent but non-violent?

Selena: Oh! I bet you fight people to the death with art creations coming to life!

Arrietty Annoyed: Really, Selena?

Arrietty: For those who don't know, Art Fight is an annual art online event taking place throughout of the month of July. It's basically an art trade where artists from around the internet joins in and draw each other's original characters. They also join in teams, themed around whatever it is of the year, and earn points attacking the opposing team. This year's teams were Seaform and Stardust.

Clara: Did you join Seafoam?

Arrietty: Nah... I've joined Stardust this year!

Selena: Purple over green? That's surprising since green is your favorite color.

Arrietty: Well... Lina (rabbitlegs) joined Seafoam so I wanted to join the counter team so we can attack each other for points!

Selena: Huh... How many points did you end up getting for your team?

Arrietty Happy: Let me see... according to my statistics... **1588.25** points! But this isn't about my art, really. This is actually about our fanart!

Nadine Shocked: Fanart?! People drew us?!

Clara: I'm flattered...!!

Selena: I hope I'm popular!

Arrietty Happy: And not just you three either, myself and another character are on this year's roster too. So I've gotten art as well!

Nadine Confused: Another character? Who is it?

Arrietty: I'll get to that soon! First... let's show fanart of our favorite robot girl, Nadine!

Nadine: Oh! It seems I've got **5** artworks drawn of me this year!? Woah... I'm popular...

Arrietty Happy: Yeah! You've got drawn more than last year, which was 3!

Clara: This wasn't your first Art Fight?

Arrietty: Well.. I barely participated last year. My character roster only contained two characters which were just me and Nadine. I was mostly just trying to get a little feel of it so I can commit more to it next year. I was a little too busy at that time anyways.

Clara: Plus this was shortly before we were around.

Arrietty: Granted, at least you had some design concept drawn but we weren't ready yet.

Selena: Come on! Enough with the chatter! Let's show 'em already!

Nadine: Okay! First up...!

%"The Prototype" - I_justdrawz

Nadine Happy: Oh! I look really cool!

Clara: Awaa... Pretty as heck too!

Arrietty Happy: That was my very first attack of the season too! They're really a great artist! I hope to see them again next year.

Nadine Glad: Yeah! Onto the next one!

%"Nadine" - RobinE

Nadine Shocked: Woah! I look really cute here...

Clara: The pose and the cutesy face really sells it here.

Selena: The smoke coming out of the arm cannon really adds a bit of cool here as well!

%"Coming soon from Emerald-Lance Productions..." - rabbitlegs

Arrietty: **SUPER FIGHTING ROBOT**

Selena: **MEGA NADINE**

Clara: **FIGHTING TO SAVE THE WORLD!**

Nadine Happy: Oh I get it! It's basically a what-if we had our own Ruby-Spears equilivent of that Mega Man show. I'd love my own show... That'd be the dream!

Clara: I hope I get to fight along side my Nadine!

Selena: Would this make me Dr. Light?

Nadine: Who would be the Proto Man I wonder...?

Clara: Or Dr. Wily...

Arrietty Annoyed: ...Yeah, about those.

Nadine Happy: Anyways... Next!

%"Nadine" - Gamedawg

Clara: Oh! Nadine looks like she's ready for action!

Selena: I bet she's already blasting away some off screen evil robots!

Nadine Glad: Pew pew pew!

Arrietty Happy: This one was a birthday gift, so it's kind of special to me.

Nadine Happy: Hehe, I look really cute there. Kinda scrimblo-y. Maybe I should star in a platformer...

Arrietty Happy: Yeah, if only there was an entire game series dedicated to that.

%"Nadine and Jack O' Diamonds" - SuperFreaksDev

Nadine Shocked: Ohh...

Clara: Wait! J-Jack O'Diamonds?!

Selena: Was this the "other character" you were speaking of?

Arrietty: I really think Nadine having that Astro Boy look really suits SuperFreaksDev's very cartoony art style. It blends pretty well along with his own characters from the Super Freaks series.

Nadine Happy: Yeah! I look like I would really fit there!

Arrietty: Jack O'Diamonds went from a somewhat spooky guy to a cartoonish spooky villain. Kind of like what you'd probably see in a hypothetical Super Freaks cartoon. Pretty expressive!

Selena: Hey! Don't avoid my question!

Arrietty: Now onto the next character... Selena!

Selena: ...

Selena: Well... it seems I got **2** pieces of art!

%"Gaming Webcomic Moment" - rabbitlegs

Nadine Shocked: You didn't tell me you've starred in a gamer web comic, Selena!

Selena: Oh, I remember this. Scruffy figured out the Mario Party meta immediately there, so he naturally won as Luigi... by doing nothing.

Nadine: Crimson seemed really into it, concentrating and all! But he ended up in last place, didn't he?

Arrietty Happy: Mario Party is certainly a game of luck... And also a good way to end friendships!

Selena: Crimson didn't want to talk to us for a week after that.

Nadine Glad: Sounds like a real webcomic moment. Oh well, his *loss*.

Selena: You stop that.

Clara: Oh hey, it's Eris! I should talk to her again sometime soon...

Selena: By the way, that green hoodie and plaided skirt was really nice... Wonder if I should make it my default casual wear?

% ![](https://i.imgur.com/Ri74EWq.png) 

%"Arrietty and Selena" - EngineerKappa)

Arrietty Sad: (embarassed)

Selena: Oh!! I remember this! I felt so *powerful* wearing that witch outfit. I never knew I could feel so... confident and cool wearing that!

Selena: Eheheheh...

Selena: Or rather... Oh ho ho ho!

Clara: Don't let it get too into your head now, little sis!

Arrietty: This one was also a birthday gift, so it was really nice! Even if... it felt awkward wearing someone else's clothes...

Selena: Don't be a downer! That outfit swap was empowering!

Arrietty Annoyed: Easy for *you* to say, Selena.

Selena: You have a problem with MY outfit?

Arrietty Sad: No, it's not that! I just had difficulty wearing those headphones on my ears...

Nadine: Well, all of that aside... Who's next?

Clara: Seems to be my turn...! I only have **1** art this year? Huh, kind of surprised. I kinda expected to be a little popular. But, it doesn't mean I didn't get an incredible piece of art in the end!

% ![](https://i.imgur.com/0bu8WhH.jpeg) 

%"SEAFOAM VS. STARDUST - New Age of Artists" - rabbitlegs)

Nadine Shocked: You're in a fighting game?!

Selena: Woah, what is your moveset??

Clara: Hehe, it's a secret! Unlock me and find out!

Nadine Happy: Clara is so coooool. She would be my main any day!

Arrietty Happy: It seems I have **3** art drawn this year. You've already seen the costume swap one though. So the one to be shown right now is the 2nd art I've received!

% ![](https://i.imgur.com/vquRJi4.png) 

%"Varietty" - VAdaPEGA

Clara: Oh! This was done in XP MSPaint according to the commentary!

Selena: This was done in an hour and 25 minutes too! Impressive!

Arrietty Happy: And on top of that, the art looks really fantastic! I'm really happy!

Nadine Glad: It's Arrietty the Variety of the Arrietty series...

Arrietty Angry: Don't push it, Nadine.

%"Arrietty Lunaris" - LexiesDoodles

Clara: The flat style is really neat!

Arrietty Happy: I especially like the posing here. I feel cool!

Nadine: You look like you're about to do some pretty magic!

Selena: Alright... so what is this about the "other character".

Arrietty: It may shock you, but it's Jack O'Diamonds.

Selena: ...Yeah, we can tell because he was in the last Nadine artwork!

Nadine: Woah, really? He's in the roster this year??

Selena: 

Arrietty: He would have appeared as our guest today, but unfortunately he's not able to. One of his minions has informed me he's too busy cleaning up and repairing his world after a gigantic skeleton warlord defeated him in arm wrestling. So I'll be commenting for him.

Clara: Huh, weird.

Arrietty: In either case... He has **3** art done this year. The first one was already shown, so...

%"Halloween time" - TryanoDoom30

Clara: Oh! Very spooky! I like the ominious atmosphere.

Selena: The orange sky makes it look kind of cool. The twilight of Halloween is approaching!

Nadine Happy: I'm feeling weirdly nostalgic for a witch costume now.

%"Master of Pumpkins, I'm Pulling Your Strings" - NEETori_Kawashiro

Selena: Oh that graveyard background is REALLY cool.

Clara: The redness of it makes it look even more deadly than the Halloween world we were warped to...

Nadine Happy: Halloween is my favorite holiday, I'd love to visit some spooky graveyard in the Halloween world again.

Selena: Oh, there's also his castle in the background!

Clara: And he wants to play cards with us... What happens if we lose?

Nadine: Well.. that's all of the art it seems!

Arrietty Shocked: Huh, I just realized something... We have two artists named after Nitori Kawashiro from the Touhou series. The other being EngineerKappa.

Selena: She's, for obvious reasons, my favorite character! I'm glad she's popular enough for that to occur!

Arrietty: Anyways, this was a pretty strong year. The last 5 days were hectic but I made sure I've contributed enough that I got plenty of art responses back. I plan to double down on my commitment next year as I was busy for various reasons this July.

Clara: I hope I get more fanart next year! But really, I'm happy I just got one. And I'm even happier Nadine is popular!

Nadine Glad: Hehe.

Arrietty: I actually have some interesting plans next year regarding the roster. I also plan to bring in at least two new characters into the mix.

Nadine Happy: I wonder who they are... Wait, you aren't talking about...?

Clara: That'll be interesting if it's who we think they are...

Arrietty Happy: Just wait until next year! Hehe

Selena: Oh hey, I just got a message from Eris and Scruffy that we're invited for some 10-player Saturn Bomberman session.

Clara: Sure! I'm down!

Nadine Glad: Watch out, this time I will win!

Arrietty Happy: Well, what's a better way to celebrate some downtime after a month of art? Let's go!

Naoshi Confused:

Naoshi: Hmm...

%See you next year!
