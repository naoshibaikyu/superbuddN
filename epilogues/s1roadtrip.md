@TITLE: Roadtrip Episode

@AUTHOR: By Arrietty

Dino: We've finally caught Nadine and Eris!! Yeah!!

Nadine Sad: (Sigh)

Eris Annoyed: You're lucky, you know that right? Lucky that we're battered from the heat and exhaustion! Lucky that we're trapped in this death road with no way out! Lucky that-

Kranion: Cope. Anyways, bro! Dino did the friggin' right thing for once!

Sticky: About time.

Dino: What should we do?

Kranion: Use them as bait for Scruffy!

Sticky: And while I'm at it, we can also expose the robot girl for who she is!

Eris Annoyed: What? I'm not a robot...

Sticky: Wasn't talking about you. I'm talking to (pointing at Nadine) her!

Kranion Angry: Ugh!! Yah still on about this, bro?

Sticky Angry: Watch it, diphead. You will finally realize I'm not the crazy one! 

Kranion Angry: Whatevah, lemme tear her apart anyways. I've got a bone to pick with her!

Nadine Annoyed: Is this still about the skull mobile?

Sticky: Can it, Kranion. I'm calling the shots here. I will make sure she will be torn apart...

Sticky Angry: ...professionally.

Nadine Shocked: (very nervous) U-um. What?!

Eris Angry: She's not a robot either, weirdo. Don't you lay a finger on her!

Sticky: Silence! Dino, get the tools and ***dismantle*** Nadine.

Nadine Happy: (interrupting) Hey how did you three end up here? Aren't we on Ludicrous World?

Sticky: ...

Dino: ...

Kranion: ...

Sticky Angry: Wait, **how** did we get here...??

Unknown: **HONK HONKKKK**

Dino: What the?

%Suddenly a floating bus has its balloons popped and it comes crashing down on the skeletons next to the girls.

Scruffy: I'm back!

Eris Angry: What the fuck?

Scruffy: Yo you won't believe what just happened! Funny story!

Nadine Sad: Can you just untie us first...
