@EPNUM: Season 1 Episode ?

@TITLE: Roadtrip Episode

@AUTHOR: By Arrietty

%The story begins with Scruffy, our favorite freak, rushing to Eris's door as if there's an emergency. Instead of knocking the door, he blows a trumpet he has with him, making a loud disruptive noise waking the poor lady up.

Eris Shocked: **SCRUFFY!** It's 4 in the MORNING. What the heck???

Scruffy: It's an emergency! (opening the door, T-Posing right at the entrance not taking a step in)

Eris Angry: What is it?!

Nadine Sad: (walking by, sleepy) Ugh... what is going on?

Scruffy: Roadtrip!

Eris Angry: What?

Scruffy: We are going to be late on a roadtrip!

Eris Angry: How is this an emergency...

Nadine Annoyed: When did we agree to this...?

Scruffy: Eris did last night! She was like "Sure whatever..."

Eris Angry: I was half asleep...

Nadine Confused: How are we late? Also I don't get a say?

Scruffy: I just figure that we all deserve a break from this city. Eris you have vacation today and your job has been overworking you. And Nadine, you've been getting bullied by Kranion all month. So let's have this whole city behind us for the day and enjoy some sight seeing!

Eris Angry: Good night.

Nadine Happy: ROADTRIP! ROADTRIP!!!

Scruffy: That's the spirit!

Eris Angry: Don't encourage him!

Nadine Sad: But he's right... The city has been the opposite of what I've hoped lately and we never got to explore this region...

Eris: Fine. I'll rest up a bit more then we can go prepare when we're awake.

Nadine Glad: Yay!

Eris Angry: But only under the condition *I* get to be the driver. I don't have much faith in Scruffy's sense of direction nor safety. ..No offense.

Scruffy: Hey none taken at all! I don't trust me either.

Nadine Happy: I can't wait to see what this region have in store for us! So many sights to see. Ahhh..  I am so excited!!

%Later as they pack up

Nadine Happy: (packing) A toothbrush... hairbrush... some clothes...

Eris: Huh? We're only going to be gone for most of the day. We don't need to pack up much.

Scruffy: (stuffing comically large items into his small bag) ...a kitchen sink, a door, a sofa, some chairs-

Eris Angry: WE ARE DEFINITELY NOT PACKING THOSE.

Scruffy: Never know when you need them!

Eris Angry: None of those are necessary!

%Nearby

Dino: (with binoculars) Hey boss.

Kranion Angry: What is it? Can't you see I am suntanning my bones?

Sticky Angry: He's talking to me, diphead. Now what is it?

Dino: It looks like Scruffy and the gang are going on a roadtrip! 

Sticky: (snatches the binocular) Let me see...

Nadine Happy: (finished packing) I call shotgun!

Eris: Alright, we do sight seeing and we'll come back by 7 in the evening at the latest. I got an early shift tomorrow, so let's make the most of it!

Scruffy: Yay! Roadtrip! Roadtrip! Roadtrip!

Nadine Happy: Roadtrip! Roadtrip! Roadtrip!

%The trio finished preparing and enters the car with Eris being the driver.

Sticky: Let's give them a roadtrip alright. To HELL! Heheheh!! HAHAHAHAHAHA...!!

Cranion: Bleh, ya losers go have fun. I'll look over the place in the meantime (grins)

Kranion Angry: Whateva you're irrelevent, friggin color swappin impostah.

Dino: Who was that again?

Sticky: Shut it and get in the skull van!


%

Dino: We've finally caught Nadine and Eris!! Yeah!!

Nadine Sad: (Sigh)

Eris Annoyed: You're lucky, you know that right? Lucky that we're battered from the heat and exhaustion! Lucky that we're trapped in this death road with no way out! Lucky that-

Kranion: Cope. Anyways, bro! Dino did the friggin' right thing for once!

Sticky: About time.

Dino: What should we do?

Kranion: Use them as bait for Scruffy!

Sticky: And while I'm at it, we can also expose the robot girl for who she is!

Eris Annoyed: What? I'm not a robot...

Sticky: Wasn't talking about you. I'm talking to (pointing at Nadine) her!

Kranion Angry: Ugh!! Yah still on about this, bro?

Sticky Angry: Watch it, diphead. You will finally realize I'm not the crazy one! 

Kranion Angry: Whatevah, lemme tear her apart anyways. I've got a bone to pick with her!

Nadine Annoyed: Is this still about the skull mobile?

Sticky: Can it, Kranion. I'm calling the shots here. I will make sure she will be torn apart...

Sticky Angry: ...professionally.

Nadine Shocked: (very nervous) U-um. What?!

Eris Angry: She's not a robot either, weirdo. Don't you lay a finger on her!

Sticky: Silence! Dino, get the tools and ***dismantle*** Nadine.

Nadine Happy: (interrupting) Hey how did you three end up here? Aren't we on Ludicrous World?

Sticky: ...

Dino: ...

Kranion: ...

Sticky Angry: Wait, **how** did we get here...??

Unknown: **HONK HONKKKK**

Dino Shocked: What the?

%Suddenly a floating bus has its balloons popped and it comes crashing down on the skeletons next to the girls.

Scruffy: I'm back!

Eris Angry: What the fuck?

Scruffy: Yo you won't believe what just happened! Funny story!

Nadine Sad: Can you just untie us first...
