@EPNUM: Season 1 Episode ?

@TITLE: Roadtrip Episode

@AUTHOR: By Arrietty

%The story begins with Scruffy, our favorite freak, rushing to Eris's door as if there's an emergency. Instead of knocking the door, he blows a trumpet he has with him, making a loud disruptive noise waking the poor lady up.

Eris Shocked: **SCRUFFY!** It's 4 in the MORNING. What the heck???

Scruffy: It's an emergency! (opening the door, T-Posing right at the entrance not taking a step in)

Eris Angry: What is it?!

Nadine Sad: (walking by, sleepy) Ugh... what is going on?

Scruffy: Roadtrip!

Eris Angry: What?

Scruffy: We are going to be late on a roadtrip!

Eris Angry: How is this an emergency...

Nadine Annoyed: When did we agree to this...?

Scruffy: Eris did last night! She was like "Sure whatever..."

Eris Angry: I was half asleep...

Nadine Confused: How are we late? Also I don't get a say?

Scruffy: I just figure that we all deserve a break from this city. Eris you have vacation today and your job has been overworking you. And Nadine, you've been getting bullied by Kranion all month. So let's have this whole city behind us for the day and enjoy some sight seeing!

Eris Angry: Good night.

Nadine Happy: ROADTRIP! ROADTRIP!!!

Scruffy: That's the spirit!

Eris Angry: Don't encourage him!

Nadine Sad: But he's right... The city has been the opposite of what I've hoped lately and we never got to explore this region...

Eris: Fine. I'll rest up a bit more then we can go prepare when we're awake.

Nadine Glad: Yay!

Eris Angry: But only under the condition *I* get to be the driver. I don't have much faith in Scruffy's sense of direction nor safety. ..No offense.

Scruffy: Hey none taken at all! I don't trust me either.

Nadine Happy: I can't wait to see what this region have in store for us! So many sights to see. Ahhh..  I am so excited!!

%Later as they pack up

Nadine Happy: (packing) A toothbrush... hairbrush... some clothes...

Eris: Huh? We're only going to be gone for most of the day. We don't need to pack up much.

Scruffy: (stuffing comically large items into his small bag) ...a kitchen sink, a door, a sofa, some chairs-

Eris Angry: WE ARE DEFINITELY NOT PACKING THOSE.

Scruffy: Never know when you need them!

Eris Angry: None of those are necessary!

%Nearby

Dino: (with binoculars) Hey boss.

Kranion Angry: What is it? Can't you see I am suntanning my bones?

Sticky Angry: He's talking to me, diphead. Now what is it?

Dino: It looks like Scruffy and the gang are going on a roadtrip! 

Sticky: (snatches the binocular) Let me see...

Nadine Happy: (finished packing) I call shotgun!

Eris: Alright, we do sight seeing and we'll come back by 7 in the evening at the latest. I got an early shift tomorrow, so let's make the most of it!

Scruffy: Yay! Roadtrip! Roadtrip! Roadtrip!

Nadine Happy: Roadtrip! Roadtrip! Roadtrip!

%The trio finished preparing and enters the car with Eris being the driver.

Sticky: Let's give them a roadtrip alright. To HELL! Heheheh!! HAHAHAHAHAHA...!!

Cranion: Bleh, ya losers go have fun. I'll look over the place in the meantime (grins)

Kranion Angry: Whateva you're irrelevent, friggin color swappin impostah.

Dino: Who was that again?

Sticky: Shut it and get in the skull van!


Nadine: (reading the map) Huh, this is really just a featureless barren wasteland.

Eris: Turn to the other side.

Nadine: (turns it around) Oh! It seems the nearest stop is 5 miles from now.

Eris: That's good. We can take a little break.

Nadine: There is a little restaurant right there too.

Eris: Hungry?

Nadine Happy: Mm-hm!

Scruffy: (mindlessly playing paddle ball) 302, 303, 304, 305... (stops for a bit) I guess I can go for some funfetti chicken...

Eris Annoyed: Do you ever get tired of that bit?

Scruffy: What bit?

Eris Annoyed: Nevermind.

Scruffy: (continues) 306, 307...

%At the stop the trio enters the restaurant. Not too long after, little do they know the skeleton trio has been searching for them.

Dino: H-Hey, Boss! I think I found them at a stop! 

Sticky: Perfect. I knew Scruffy would stop at the Funfetti Restaurant and I have an idea.

Kranion Angry: Ah brotha, here we go...

Sticky Angry: Can it! What was I gonna say... ah yeah-

Sticky: We slash their tires and then when they come back and try to start the car then we ambush them. Easy as pie.

Kranion: Yawn... that's lame and unimaginative.

Sticky Angry: Oh yeah? Why don't you come up witha better one if you're so smart.

Dino: ...

Kranion Angry: Uhh... 

Sticky Angry: Well?

Dino: Guys.

Kranion: Why don't we flatten their tires and then beat them to death! (crosses arms smugly)

Sticky Angry: That's the same exact plan as mine you nincompoop!!

Dino: Guys!

Sticky Angry: Shut up! We are doing a classic pointless brother to brother bickering!

Kranion Angry: Yah!! Shut it!!

%Eris's car goes past them.

Sticky: What the-

Kranion Angry: Dino! Why didn't you say anything?

Dino: I tried to!

Sticky: Whatever. After them!

%

Eris Annoyed: (completely deadpan) ...

Nadine Happy: (eating Funfetti cake happily)

Scruffy: (eating Funfetti Chicken) Told you I wasn't doing a bit!

Eris Annoyed: ...

Nadine Happy: I've saved a slice for you!

Eris: Thank you Nadine but I've kinda lost my appetite.

Nadine Glad: More cake for me!

%Minutes later, Scruffy turns his back around and notices the Skull Van nearby.

Kranion: (holding a rocket launcher) Ready to fire, bro.

Scruffy: Huh, didn't expect to see them!

Nadine Confused: Huh? You said something?

Scruffy: Don't worry about it, just talking to myself.

Nadine: Okay.

%Scruffy hastily tosses tiny spikes out of the window.

%**Pop!!**

Sticky: OUR TIRES!! WE'RE SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL!!

Dino Shocked: WHAT DO WE DO BOSS?!

Kranion: PANIC!!

Sticky Angry: I'M THE BOSS-

%The trio crashes into a nearby tree, Kranion's rocket launcher goes off hitting the tree and it falls over on the van, crushing it and blocking the road.

Nadine Confused: What was that?!

Scruffy: Traffic.

Nadine: Must've been a real serious accident... right Eris?

Nadine Confused: Eris?

Eris: (asleep at the wheel) Zzzz...

Nadine Shocked: U-Uh- ERIS WAKE UP!! (attempts to steer the wheel in a panic)

Eris Shocked: H-Huh wh-

%The car swerves off road, the trio screams as the car drives nearly off the hill but Nadine hits the breaks on time.

Eris Shocked: Ugh... What happened?

Nadine Shocked: (shaken) Y-you fell asleep and we almost drove off the hill!

Eris: Nadine! I'm so sorry- I...

Nadine Happy: That was scary and fun!!! Can we do it again?

Eris Annoyed: ...No! I had enough near death crashing experiences in my life.

Scruffy: And how!

Eris: Nadine, can you drive in my place? I don't think I'm rested enough...

Nadine Sad: I never drove a car... No license either.

Eris: ...

Scruffy: You can count on me-

Eris Angry: No!

Nadine: I can keep him in check! I promise we will be perfectly okay! You can change back when you rest enough.

Eris: Okay... Just make sure he doesn't somehow land us on a whole other planet or something.

Nadine: Uh, aye aye!

%The trio drives off again with Scruffy as the current driver. Eris rests in the back seat with the pillow and blanket that Nadine had packed. As minutes pass, Eris falls asleep.

Eris: (waking up) Mmmm..? (Looking at the window) Why are we in a desert... full of... mountains made of BARRELS?!

Scruffy: Oh hey! Funny story.

Eris Annoyed: Scruffy!! Are we in Barrel Canyon?!

Scruffy: The interstate of Barrel Canyon!

Eris Angry: How?! I was just joking!!

Scruffy: (shrugs)

Nadine Confused: I've been keeping an eye out too. One moment I blinked and the next we are suddenly here! Interesting sight though! What's the problem?

Eris: WE AREN'T ON EARTH ANYMORE!

Nadine Shocked: What?!

Scruffy: Haha yeah we're somehow on Ludicrous World! Buckle up! It'll be a wild ride!

Nadine Shocked: We... are on another planet? For real?

Eris Angry: How did this happened?! Tell me the truth! How long was I out?!

Scruffy: Dunno how we got here! (shrugs earnestly)

Nadine: And you were only asleep for like two minutes.

Eris Annoyed: ...

Scruffy: That's okay! It'll only take us 8 hours to get out of here!

Eris Annoyed: ... ...

Nadine Sad: ...Can't we just turn around?

Scruffy: Nope! We'd only hit an invisible wall! And if we touch the edges of the road, we will be blown back to the start!

Eris Annoyed: ... ... ...

Nadine: Sounds like a weird video game!

Scruffy: But real!

Eris Annoyed: (curls into a ball)

Nadine: I guess I'll keep counting the utility poles we've been passing by. 230... 231... 232...

Scruffy: On the bright side, there is a really nice monument right at the end of the road!

Eris Annoyed: ... ... ... ...

Nadine: Ohh, is it worth it?

Scruffy: You betcha it is!

Nadine Happy: How exciting and also grueling...

Eris Annoyed: (thud)

%Overwhelmed and exhausted, Eris drops asleep again.

Nadine Sad: ...Oh.

Scruffy: Eh, we'll be halfway through on the next stop.

Nadine Shocked: H-half way? (picks up map and looks at the back) Wow. It really is a barren wasteland... 380... 381... 382...

%Later...

Scruffy: Oh hey! A suspiciously highly detailed rat!

Nadine Happy: (looking at the sides of the road) Ohhh... Weird!

Scruffy: Not as weird as the monument we're going to see!

Nadine Happy: Yay!

Nadine: ...

Nadine Sad: This is kind of boring...

Nadine Happy: Hey can I learn how to drive? It's a straight road so that can't be too hard, right?

Scruffy: Sure!

%Meanwhile

Kranion Angry: Oh!! That does it! We are really gonna make it personal!!

Dino: But boss, you've been making it personal the entire time.

Sticky Angry: (glares) I am the boss for the last time!

Dino: Sorry Boss Sticky...

Kranion Angry: (glares at Sticky) No! I am the Boss! And I am leading the charge! 

Dino: (sweating) C-Can't we work as a team or s-something?

Kranion Angry: What team? I'm only here because I have a personal vendetta against Nadine!

Sticky Angry: And I'm only here because I have a life-long personal vendetta against Scruffy AND my diphead brother.

Kranion Angry: Oh yeah? Why don't you fight me then, diphead?

Sticky Angry: You're only here so I can prove you wrong! I'll probably kill you later.

Kranion Angry: Bro, you're still really on about that dumb robot thing?!

Sticky: Whatever. DINO! ETA on the repairs?

Dino: All ready, b-boss!

Kranion Angry: ...

Sticky: And the rocket thrusters?

Dino: Installed and ready, sir!

Sticky: Excellent... Let's give them a surprise.

%

Nadine Happy: What happens if I press the gas and the brake at the same time?

Scruffy: The car takes a screenshot.

Eris Annoyed: (jolts up awake) Pull over. I’m driving now!

Nadine: Okay! (successfully stops the car) Oh hey, I did it right this time!

%As Nadine and Eris gets out of the car to swap seats...

Eris Shocked: (opening the driver seats door) Wait, do you hear that?

Nadine Confused: Sounds like its coming from behind-

Kranion: SURPRISE FUCKERS-

Sticky Angry: DINO! YOU IDIOT! WE WENT WAY PAST THEM! ***TURN AROUND!***

Dino Shocked: SORRY BOSS THE THRUSTERS ARE TOO FAST!! 

Kranion Angry: THEN PUT A BREAK ON THEM AND TURN!!

%The skull van swerves around but immediately gets blown away by the mysterious wind for going off road.

Sticky Angry: YOU IDIOTSSSSS....

%The skull van disappears from view.

Eris Annoyed: Huh? What was that all about?

Scruffy: (knowing smile) Heh heh beats me.

Nadine Confused: Huh... anyways... Are you well rested? You've slept for 2 hours. 

Eris: Yeah I think that was enough to keep me going for the rest of the... trip. Do we really have 6 hours more of this?

Scruffy: We can listen to the radio to pass time!

%

Nadine Confused: Hey, the radio host told us to "Press L to Learn". What does that mean?

Eris: But there is no L button.

Nadine Sad: Awww... it'll forever be a mystery...

Scruffy: (eating funfetti chicken)

Eris Annoyed: Hasn't those gotten bad by now?

Scruffy: Not when they're injected with funfetti!

Nadine Sad: ...

Eris: Okay nevermind, I don't want to know anymore.

Scruffy: I'm freaks.

%A low tone beep plays.

Nadine Sad: Don't tell me...

Eris: Our gas is getting really low!

Scruffy: (searching the bags) We don't have any gas canisters either!

Eris: Is there no gas stations here?

Scruffy: No but we can stop at the balloon store in the next hour.

Eris Annoyed: ...Why?

Scruffy: To buy balloons.

Eris Angry: This isn't funny. We're in danger, Scruffy.

Nadine Sad: Are we going to be okay?

%The last bit of gas finally gives out.

Nadine Sad: No!

Eris Annoyed: Anddd that's it. The gas is all used up. We're stuck. Stuck in this endless hell of an interstate. (slams her head on the steering wheel in utter defeat)

Nadine Sad: Eris...

%Scruffy thinks very hard til his head hurts bad then he gets an idea.

Scruffy: (clutching his head) One moment.

Nadine Confused: What are you doing?

%Scruffy gets out of the car then sits on the road.

Eris Annoyed: Even he has given up...

%Scruffy slowly levitates above the road and starts making engine noises.

Nadine Shocked: Uh...

Scruffy: Be back in a few minutes.

%VROOOM. Scruffy takes off like a car!

Eris Shocked: 

Nadine Shocked: 

Eris Shocked:

Dino: We've finally caught Nadine and Eris!! Yeah!!

Nadine Sad: (Sigh)

Eris Annoyed: You're lucky, you know that right? Lucky that we're battered from the heat and exhaustion! Lucky that we're trapped in this death road with no way out! Lucky that-

Kranion: Cope. Anyways, bro! Dino did the friggin' right thing for once!

Sticky: About time.

Dino: What should we do?

Kranion: Use them as bait for Scruffy!

Sticky: And while I'm at it, we can also expose the robot girl for who she is!

Eris Annoyed: What? I'm not a robot...

Sticky: Wasn't talking about you. I'm talking to (pointing at Nadine) her!

Kranion Angry: Ugh!! Yah still on about this, bro?

Sticky Angry: Watch it, diphead. You will finally realize I'm not the crazy one! 

Kranion Angry: Whatevah, lemme tear her apart anyways. I've got a bone to pick with her!

Nadine Annoyed: Is this still about the skull mobile?

Sticky: Can it, Kranion. I'm calling the shots here. I will make sure she will be torn apart...

Sticky Angry: ...professionally.

Nadine Shocked: (very nervous) U-um. What?!

Eris Angry: She's not a robot either, weirdo. Don't you lay a finger on her!

Sticky: Silence! Dino, get the tools and ***dismantle*** Nadine.

Nadine Happy: (interrupting) Hey how did you three end up here? Aren't we on Ludicrous World?

Sticky: ...

Dino: ...

Kranion: ...

Sticky Angry: Wait, **how** did we get here...??

Unknown: **HONK HONKKKK**

Dino Shocked: What the?

%Suddenly a floating bus has its balloons popped and it comes crashing down on the skeletons next to the girls.

Scruffy: I'm back!

Eris Angry: What the fuck?

Scruffy: Yo you won't believe what just happened! Funny story!

Nadine Sad: Can you just untie us first...
