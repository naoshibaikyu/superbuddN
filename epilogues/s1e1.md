Eris Happy: I have a variety of emotes for my mugshot!

Rhea: Unfair, I only have the neutral one!

Eris Shocked: What a shame! Not my fault our mugshots are just placeholders.

Rhea: You're just flexing by this point.

Eris Happy: Or is the author flexing the emote format?

Rhea: Hmmm...

Scruffy: Hey! Wanna see me crack open a B.U.D.D for an omelette???

Eris Annoyed: **[being held back by Rhea]** I am going to *fucking gut your insides* with a **rusty knife**.

Scruffy: Oh, look! Markdown support! How **bold** of you!

Nadine: Hey, you okay sir?

Kranion: Of course I am, chump! **[reaches for his pockets, finding it empty]** Hey... You stole friggin' wallet!!!

Nadine: Me?!

Nadine: ...Marrow Who? 

Kranion: Are you frickin' serious?? Now you're insultin' my dad? Ah ya askin' for a death wish??

%Kranion charges towards Nadine with his fist clenched, ready to throw a punch.

Nadine: Woa, wait now! **[shoots Kranion's head out of reflex]**

Kranion: **[head spins on impact]]** W-Woa-waoaaaahhh!!

Nadine: Uh... O-oops. Uh.

Kranion: **[grabs his head to stop spinning and twists it back in place]** What the frick?? How did you do that??

Sticky: Are you seriously letting this little girl kick your ass?

Dino: Yeah!!

Sticky: Shut it, Dino.

Kranion: Nevah! She's still just chump! I'mma bust out secret weapon and see who's having the laughin'.

%The ground shakes suddenly, catching the attention of every bystander nearby. A Skullmobile, his flying vehicle with attachable weapons, pops out of the ground. Kranion hops into the mobile and it floats above the ground.

Kranion: Alright, yah thief. Prepare ta get wrecked!

Kranion: 

Kranion: Dino, how do I friggin' activate the stupid attachment you've installed.

Dino: Press the green button, you idiot!

%Kranion presses the green button, it activates a swinging wrecking ball appearing from under the flying vehicle.

Kranion: Friggin' sweet. This is just like that porcupine game.

Nadine: ...

Kranion: Why ain't ya scared? 

Nadine: I don't know. ...I'm just kind of used to this, honestly.

Kranion: Whateva', prepare to get smoked! **[swings the wrecking ball towards Nadine]**

Nadine: **[gets in a ready stance right before performing her Slide Kick towards the ball, on impact, the ball gets swung in the opposite direction and so hard that it comes around and hits Kranion on the head]**

Kranion: **[rubbing his head]** WHAT THE FRIGGIN' HELL, LADY???

%In the crowd.

Scruffy: **[shoving through the crowd]** Oh hey, I found Nadine!

Eris: What?

Scruffy: And she's fighting Kranion!

Eris Shocked: WHAT?!

Scruffy: **[takes popcorn out of the bag]** Want some?

Eris: *NO!*

%The two combatants glare at each other.

Nadine: ...

Kranion: ...

Nadine: Well now what?

Kranion: What ta friggin' mean now what??

Nadine: I don't know. I just kinda expected more, but we've been just glaring at each other for a few minutes now.

Kranion: ...

Nadine: ...

Kranion: **[grows a mustache suddenly]** ...

Nadine: ...

Cranion: **HEY!**

Cranion: I thought we were grocery shoppin'!

Kranion: I *would* but this annoyin' lady over here stole my friggin' wallet.

Sticky: **[holding up the wallet]** I literally had the wallet the whole time. Right here.

Kranion: Sticky?! You STOLE my wallet? I knew I shouldn't trust ya!!

Sticky: No, diphead. You lend me it.

Kranion: THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY ANYTHANG?

Sticky: Honestly just wanted to see where this was going. Also the opportunity to witness your utter humiliation. Or the destruction of the girl.

Kranion:

Sticky: Mainly the humiliation bit.

Cranion: Are we gonna go or not??

Kranion: Whateva'. **[points at Nadine]** This ain't ta last time you see me.

Nadine: Oh. Bye.
