%Meanwhile

Nadine: **[entering the shop, waving at Clara]**

Clara: **[waving back]** Hello, how may I help you cutie?

Clara: Did you know that you can inject Funfetti into raw chicken? It tastes very fucking good.

Nadine: 

Clara: 

Nadine: 

Clara: I'm freaks.

%Nadine slowly backs out of the store.

Clara: **[sobbing uncontrollably]**

Selena: Congrats, Sis! You've blew it!


%Meanwhile

Eris: Holy shit.

Rhea: Language. Also what?

Eris Happy: I have a variety of emotes for my mugshot!

Rhea: Unfair, I only have the neutral one!

Eris Shocked: What a shame! Not my fault our mugshots are just placeholders.

Rhea: You're just flexing by this point.

Eris Happy: Or is the author flexing the emote format?

Rhea: Hmmm...

Scruffy: Hey! Wanna see me crack open a B.U.D.D for an omelette???

Eris Annoyed: **[being held back by Rhea]** I am going to *fucking gut your insides* with a **rusty knife**.

Scruffy: Oh, look! Markdown support! How **bold** of you!

Clara: Help! Nadine won't respond to my text anymore!


%New Content. Wow.

%Snippet of a potential fight scene.

Kranion: **[getting up after tripping badly]** McFriggin' ow!! What the freak. 

Nadine Shocked: Hey, you okay sir?

Kranion: Of course I am, chump! **[reaches for his pockets, finding it empty]** Hey... You stole friggin' wallet!!!

Nadine: Me?!

Kranion: Who the heck else?? **[cracking knuckles]** No one steals from the great son of Marrow Prime and gets away wit it.

Nadine Annoyed: ...Marrow Who? 

Kranion: Are you frickin' serious?? Now you're insultin' my dad? Ah ya askin' for a death wish??

%Kranion charges towards Nadine with his fist clenched, ready to throw a punch.

Nadine Shocked: Woa, wait now! **[shoots Kranion's head out of reflex]**

Kranion: **[head spins on impact]]** W-Woa-waoaaaahhh!!

Nadine Shocked: Uh... O-oops. Uh.

Kranion: **[grabs his head to stop spinning and twists it back in place]** What the frick?? How did you do that??

Sticky: Are you seriously letting this little girl kick your ass?

Dino: Yeah!!

Sticky: Shut it, Dino.

Kranion: Nevah! She's still just chump! I'mma bust out secret weapon and see who's having the laugh!!

%The ground shakes suddenly, catching the attention of every bystander nearby. A Skullmobile, his flying vehicle with attachable weapons, pops out of the ground. Kranion hops into the mobile and it floats above the ground.

Kranion: Alright, yah thief. Prepare ta get wrecked!

Kranion: 

Kranion: Dino, how do I friggin' activate the stupid attachment you've installed.

Dino: Press the green button, you idiot!

%Kranion presses the green button, it activates a swinging wrecking ball appearing from under the flying vehicle.

Kranion: Friggin' sweet. This is just like that porcupine game.

Nadine Annoyed: ...

Kranion: Why ain't ya scared? 

Nadine: I don't know. ...I'm just kind of used to this, honestly.

Kranion: Whateva', prepare to get smoked! **[swings the wrecking ball towards Nadine]**

Nadine: **[gets in a ready stance right before performing her Slide Kick towards the ball, on impact, the ball gets swung in the opposite direction and swings so hard that it comes around from behind the machine and hits Kranion on the head]**

Kranion: **[rubbing his head]** WHAT THE FRIGGIN' HELL, LADY???

%In the crowd.

Scruffy: **[shoving through the crowd]** Oh hey, I found Nadine!

Eris: What?

Scruffy: And she's fighting Kranion!

Eris Shocked: WHAT?!

Scruffy: **[takes popcorn out of the bag]** Want some?

Eris: *NO!*

%The two combatants glare at each other.

Nadine Angry: ...

Kranion: ...

Nadine Annoyed: Well now what?

Kranion: What ta friggin' mean now what??

Nadine Confused: I don't know. I just kinda expected more, but we've been just glaring at each other for a few minutes now.

Kranion: ...

Nadine Angry: ...

Kranion: ...

Nadine Angry: ...

Kranion: ...

Nadine Angry: ...

Kranion: **[grows a mustache suddenly]** ...

Nadine Angry: ...

Cranion: **HEY!**

Cranion: I thought we were grocery shoppin'!

Kranion: I *would* but this annoyin' lady over here stole my friggin' wallet.

Sticky: **[holding up the wallet]** I literally had the wallet the whole time. Right here.

Kranion: Bro?! You STOLE my wallet? I knew I shouldn't trust ya!!

Sticky: No, diphead. You lend me it.

Kranion: THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY ANYTHANG?

Sticky: Honestly just wanted to see where this was going. Also the opportunity to witness your utter humiliation. Or the unlikely destruction of the girl.

Kranion:

Sticky: Mainly the humiliation bit.

Cranion: Are we gonna go or not??

Kranion: Whateva'. **[points at Nadine]** This ain't ta last time you see me.

Nadine: Oh. Bye.

%Later at Clara's Shop van.

Selena: That's a weird way for your day to go.

Nadine Confused: I guess so. I'm just a little confused about that encounter was all.

Clara: You're not hurt, are you?

Nadine: I'm fine. He didn't even manage to land a hit on me!

Selena: But you do know you've potentially compromised your secret, right?

Nadine Annoyed: ...I guess. I kinda forgot Humans don't do slide kicks or materialize guns out of their hands. I... kinda reacted on impulse.

Clara: A lot of people here aren't really Human either. So maybe you won't stick out like you would back in our society and I'm sure they'd accept you for who you are. You sure you want to keep your identity a secret here?

Nadine Sad: Well, it's just I don't really feel comfortable here yet. I want to live like a Human like I've been doing, even here. I also kind of want to think less about my combative life and more on my "Human" side. I guess it's just comfort to keep myself together.

Selena: Huh... 

Nadine: Besides, all of them are strangers to me.

Selena: That's understandable. There is a bit of a baggage weighing you down and you need time to even process the idea to begin with.

Nadine: Yeah... 

Nadine Happy: The talk has kind of eased me a bit. I should probably head back home. Thanks, you two.

% As the Rivera sisters wave good night to Nadine, she walks out of the van to head back to her apartment. She suddenly hears a footstep.

Nadine Confused: Huh?

% ...

Nadine Confused: Hm... **[continues on her way back]**

Sticky: **[hiding behind a tree]** ...
