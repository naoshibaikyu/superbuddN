### ACT I

Nadine: Huh... So this is finally it. I'm on my own now.

Nadine Sad: No Clara and Selena to be around for me... But there's no more fights against robot armies or getting trapped in dark dimensions. Just... a completely new life.

%She sighs and then looks at the door with the number "403" bolted onto it.

Nadine Confused: And I'm about to room with two people I've never met before... Bittersweet.

%Calmly she knocks on the door. A moment after the door finally opens.

Eris: Huh- Oh hey! You're our new roommate, aren't you?

Nadine Shocked: Y-Yeah...

Eris Happy: Nice to meet you! My name's Eris and my other roommate is-

%Not a moment sooner, a strange freaky guy appears.

Scruffy: Hey! A visitor!

Eris: -...Scruffy. That isn't a visitor, this is our new roommate.

Scruffy: Cool! I think I've seen her before anyways.

Nadine Shocked: Huh? Me? You must be mistaken.

Scruffy: Yeah! When Sticky tried to make the Powerful Monkey Council into his perfect power source and you were there in a ship shooting things down while rescuing the monkeys!

Nadine Shocked:

Eris Annoyed: Don't mind him. He's a bit of a strange one and told me the same exact joke when I met him in Ludicrous World.

Nadine Confused: I see...

Eris: But enough about us, come right in, uhhh-

Nadine: Nadine.

%In the living room.

Eris: **[getting snacks to share]** It must've been a long trip to this island. Where are you from, Nadine?

Nadine: [RETRACTED]. It's a pretty quiet and tranquil place.

Nadine Sad: Usually. When robots aren't taking over.

Eris Happy: Oh? Maybe I can take care of the problem! (I'm sure the Colony would've paid decent there.)

Nadine Happy: It's okay now. Some hero stopped them and it's been peaceful since. Where are you from anyways? 

Eris: Space.

Nadine Confused: Huh? Space?

Eris: A space colony to be more specific! My room was about the size of a closet so I decided to move here.

Nadine Confused: 

Scruffy: And I'm from the United States of Craziness!

Eris: Unfortunately, he's not lying this time.

Scruffy: I haven't lied at all!

Nadine Happy: Wait, that sounds great! Tell me more about this United States of Craziness!

Eris: And space was too weird for you?

Scruffy: It's a pretty chill and dope galaxy! We can do whatever we want as long as it's harmless!

Nadine Happy: Oh!! We should've moved there!

Scruffy: Well, I can't! I'm hiding from the *IRS*! Seriously!

Nadine Sad: 

%Nadine, just finishing her snacks, hastily gets off the sofa.

Nadine Sad: Umm... Where is my bedroom?

Scruffy: **[getting off the arm rest of the sofa]** Don't you want a tour around the apartment first?

Eris: We can do the tour later. Your room is in the little hallway, at the left.

Nadine Happy: Thank you!

%She hurriedly runs to her room and slams the door shut.

Eris: Hm... (Poor girl. She's probably confused.)

Scruffy: Hey Eris! Wanna see me crack open a B.U.D.D for an omelets???

Eris Angry: I'll end you.

### ACT II

%Later evening in Nadine's room

Nadine Sad: (laying on her bed) It's been a few hours already and there is still just so much to take in...

Nadine Shocked: Oh! I should probably call Clara and Selena and let them know I've arrived safely! Wouldn't want them too worried...!

%Suddenly there's a knock on the door.

Nadine Shocked: Ah! C-come in?

Eris: Sorry! Didn't mean to startle. Are you feeling any better?

Nadine: Yeah I was just a little overwhelmed earlier, that's all. 

Eris: Good! We're thinking of ordering some takeout. In a mood for anything in particular?

Scruffy: I can cook up something *fun* if you want instead!

Eris: We are NOT injecting funfetti into raw meat again, Scruffy.

Nadine Annoyed: ...???

Scruffy: Come on! Funfettiiii...

Eris Angry: *NO.*

%Act II to be continued for now...

@ACTNUM: ACT III

Kranion Angry: **[getting up after tripping badly]** McFriggin' ow!! What the freak. 

Nadine Shocked: Hey, you okay sir?

Kranion Angry: Of course I am, chump! **[reaches for his pockets, finding it empty]** Hey... You stole friggin' wallet!!!

Nadine: Me?!

Kranion Angry: Who the heck else?? **[cracking knuckles]** No one steals from the great son of Marrow Prime and gets away wit it.

Nadine Annoyed: ...Marrow Who? 

Kranion Angry: Are you frickin' serious?? Now you're insultin' my dad? Ah ya askin' for a death wish??

%Kranion charges towards Nadine with his fist clenched, ready to throw a punch.

Nadine Shocked: Woa, wait now! **[shoots Kranion's head out of reflex]**

Kranion: **[head spins on impact]]** W-Woa-waoaaaahhh!!

Nadine Shocked: Uh... O-oops. Uh.

Kranion Angry: **[grabs his head to stop spinning and twists it back in place]** What the frick?? How did you do that??

Sticky: Are you seriously letting this little girl kick your ass?

Dino: Yeah!!

Sticky: Shut it, Dino.

Kranion: Nevah! She's still just chump! I'mma bust out secret weapon and see who's having the laugh!!

%The ground shakes suddenly, catching the attention of every bystander nearby. A Skullmobile, his flying vehicle with attachable weapons, pops out of the ground. Kranion hops into the mobile and it floats above the ground.

Kranion: Alright, yah thief. Prepare ta get wrecked!

Kranion: 

Kranion Angry: Dino, how do I friggin' activate the stupid attachment you've installed.

Dino: Press the green button, you idiot!

%Kranion presses the green button, it activates a swinging wrecking ball appearing from under the flying vehicle.

Kranion: Friggin' sweet. This is just like that porcupine game.

Nadine Annoyed: ...

Kranion: Why ain't ya scared? 

Nadine: I don't know. ...I'm just kind of used to this, honestly.

Kranion Angry: Whateva', prepare to get smoked! **[swings the wrecking ball towards Nadine]**

Nadine: **[gets in a ready stance right before performing her Slide Kick towards the ball, on impact, the ball gets swung in the opposite direction and swings so hard that it comes around from behind the machine and hits Kranion on the head]**

Kranion Angry: **[rubbing his head]** WHAT THE FRIGGIN' HELL, LADY???

%In the crowd.

Scruffy: **[shoving through the crowd]** Oh hey, I found Nadine!

Eris: What? Where?

Scruffy: **[pointing at her direction]** And she's fighting Kranion!

Eris Shocked: WHAT?!

Scruffy: **[takes popcorn out of the bag]** This could be a fun watch. Want some popcorn?

Eris Angry: *NOT RIGHT NOW!*

%The two combatants glare at each other.

Nadine Angry: ...

Kranion Angry: ...

Nadine Annoyed: Well now what?

Kranion: What ta friggin' mean now what??

Nadine Confused: I don't know. I just kinda expected more, but we've been just glaring at each other for a few minutes now.

Kranion Angry: ...

Nadine Angry: ...

Kranion Angry: ...

Nadine Angry: ...

Kranion Angry: ...

Nadine Angry: ...

Kranion Angry: **[grows a mustache suddenly]** ...

Nadine Angry: ...

Cranion Angry: **HEY!**

Cranion: I thought we were grocery shoppin'!

Kranion Angry: I *would* but this annoyin' lady over here stole my friggin' wallet.

Sticky: **[holding up the wallet]** I literally had the wallet the whole time. Right here.

Kranion Angry: Bro?! You STOLE my wallet? I knew I shouldn't trust ya!!

Sticky: No, diphead. You lend me it.

Kranion Angry: THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY ANYTHANG?

Sticky: Honestly just wanted to see where this was going. Also the opportunity to witness your utter humiliation. Or the unlikely destruction of the girl.

Kranion Angry:

Sticky: Mainly the humiliation bit.

Cranion: Are we gonna go or not??

Kranion: Whateva'. **[points at Nadine]** This ain't ta last time you see me.

Nadine: Oh. Bye.

%Kranion's crew walks away from the scene, but not before Sticky giving another glance at Nadine with a glare before leaving.

Nadine Confused: Huh?

Scruffy: Yo!

Eris: (rushing in) Nadine! Are you hurt?

Nadine: Huh? Oh yeah. I'm okay. He didn't manage to lay a finger on me.

Eris: Still! You've gotta be careful around people like him!

Nadine Sad: Can we talk about this in the apartment? I'm kind of ready to go home now.

%Later in the apartment, Nadine asked questions about Kranion and his "crew".

Nadine Confused: ...You know him, Scruffy?

Scruffy: I do! He's basically my arch-nemesis! Did I ever tell you he ruled the galaxy over losing a game of Fast Cars Underground 2?

Nadine Sad: ...So I was fighting a space dictator? ...Over a wallet?

Scruffy: More like an idiot with too much power. Me and my freak pals stopped his reign pretty quick!

Scruffy: Now, his identical twin, uh... "Cranion", with a C. He is just literally Kranion but blue. I don't know anything about him and neither does Kranion himself I think.

Nadine Confused: That doesn't make sense, wouldn't he be his twin brother or something?

Scruffy: Beats me! He has an actual brother though and you should be careful around him.

Nadine: Is that the weird dino dude?

Scruffy: Nah. Dino is a total wimp. Easy to bully too!

Eris: I can attest to that.

Scruffy: Now, the one with the hat, on the other hand? That's Sticky and he's pretty cunning. He *was* our arch-nemesis but he kind of fell out of the picture, so his brother, Kranion, has been usually the one causing incidents these days. They both also don't get along at all.

Nadine Confused: Huh? I wonder why Sticky's hanging around with his brother then?

Scruffy: Beats me, I was surprised to see him around!

Eris: Still though... How did you even stand against Kranion that well? He didn't even get to lay a finger on you?

Nadine Happy: Oh, it wasn't a big deal really. We didn't even get to trade punches or anything. He wacked himself with his wrecking ball on total accident.

Eris: Huh?

Scruffy: Works for me.

Nadine Sad: It's getting late anyways, I should sleep. It was a long day.

Eris: It's only 7PM but if you say so...

%Later at Nadine's room. Nadine is on a call with both Selena and Clara.

Selena: Hm... Kind of a scary way to end your day.

Nadine Confused: By my standards, not really. I've fought way worse, Selena.

Selena: But you do know you've nearly exposed your secret, right? That's the problem here.

Nadine Annoyed: ...I guess. I kinda forgot Humans don't do slide kicks or materialize guns out of their hands. I... kinda reacted on impulse.

Clara: From what you've described, there does seem a lot of non-Human folks living there too.  I'm sure human-like robots aren't too out there. You sure you want to keep your identity a secret here?

Nadine Sad: It's really actually not safe for me anywhere to reveal that.

Selena: And we have to keep in mind that Nadine is a very *unique* kind of robot. Enough to get world governments eyes on her and trying to do anything funny about it if they find out about her non-human existence.

Clara: That *is* true. 

Nadine Sad: Besides, I want to live like a Human here too. I really prefer to forget my combative life. I guess it's just comfort to keep myself together.

Clara: Mmm...

Nadine Sad: I trust my roommates but not enough to entrust my secret with them... I'm glad they've missed most of my fight or they'd been really suspicious of it!

Clara: That's understandable. Even with that level of trust, you'd still need time to even process the idea to begin with.

Selena: And just remember, Nadine. If things gets beyond dire, don't hesitate to call us over. I can get your battle body here as soon as possible. Who knows if danger like them threatens the world again?

Nadine: Scruffy can take care of that problem himself.

Selena: I suppose so. 

Nadine Happy: The talk has kind of eased me a bit despite my uncertain future. Thanks for understanding me, you two.

Clara: Anytime! Call us again whenever you need to lend an ear!

%As the Rivera sisters say good night to Nadine, she hangs up the call. She suddenly hears a footstep from outside her window.

Nadine Confused: Huh? **[looks out the window, but she sees no one in sight]**

%...

Nadine Annoyed: Hm...

%Nadine turns around to turn off the bedroom light and rests in her bed.

Sticky: **[hiding behind a tree]** ...

%Uh oh. It looks like Sticky was eavesdropping! What is this nefarious skeleton up to? Will Nadine get her secret exposed or- 

Sticky: Shut the freak up, already. I haven't decided what I want to do yet!

%Sorry.
