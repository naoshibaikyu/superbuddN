@TITLE: Episode Title

@AUTHOR: By King Author

<!-- The episode starts here. Feel free to erase this line. -->

%The percent sign is what we use for narration or dialog said by no character.

Nadine: This is an example of Nadine, with a neutral expression, saying something.

Nadine Angry: This is an example of Nadine, but angry. Remember to type their names properly along with the emote (if needed).

%Right now there are several universal emotes, but most characters at the moment don't have most of these.

Nadine: Neutral

Nadine Annoyed: Annoyed

Nadine Angry: Angry

Nadine Sad: Sad

Nadine Happy: Happy

Nadine Glad: Glad

Nadine Shocked: Shocked

Scruffy: This is another character. The freak himself!!

Scruffy Shocked: Unfortunately he does not have Shocked right now. So he'll look like this. But that is okay because that can be solved by having the webmaster insert a mugshot emote of that. So it's fine to have this here because it doesn't mess with the formatting at all.

Dumbass: A character named "Dumbass" does not exist in the character database file, unlike Nadine and Scruffy. So he'll be displayed with no mugshot, so it's safe to assume it's a random unimportant NPC. If you want a mugshot for a character, we can talk about making a mugshot and adding them in. The webmaster handles it all! ovo7

Eris: Oh yeah, by the way. Markdown is supported.

Scruffy: It's pretty **bold** of you to mention this in front of a bunch of *italics*. ***Bold Italics.***

Eris Annoyed: Stop.

Kranion Angry: SHUT UP I'M TRYING TO SLEEP

Stick Angry: FOR REAL OR WE'LL SKIN YOU ALL ALIVE.

Eris Shocked: Sorry.

Dino: Hey boss-

%**SFX:** Slice!

Dino Shocked: ***AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-***

%The end.
